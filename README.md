A React + TypeScript web app that helps expectant mothers track pregnancy progress week by week with information fetched from credible sources 
l. The app provides interactive cards, week-An interactive, human-centered web platform designed to bridge maternal health knowledge gaps in local Ghanaian communities.
Built through participatory design with healthcare professionals and grounded in Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) and Health Belief Model (HBM) principles.

🎯 Overview

Maternal mortality in low-resource settings is often preventable through improved awareness of danger signs, nutrition, and antenatal care (ANC) importance. This platform delivers WHO-aligned educational content in a clear, culturally contextualized format to empower expectant mothers and caregivers.

Through an HCI-driven process, the platform emphasizes usability, localization, and trust, helping users with varying digital literacy levels access reliable maternal health information.

🧩 Research & Design Approach
1. User Research

Conducted a survey with 15 local healthcare professionals to uncover maternal health knowledge gaps.

Identified priority areas: danger sign awareness, nutritional guidance, and ANC participation.

Used insights to inform both content architecture and interaction design.

2. Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) Methods

Applied user-centered design principles to tailor learning experiences for different literacy levels.

Designed interface prototypes focusing on readability, iconography, and culturally relevant visuals.

Conducted informal usability testing with target users to refine information flow and accessibility.

3. Behavioral Design Integration

Incorporated Health Belief Model (HBM) principles such as:

Perceived Susceptibility: Personalizing risk messages related to maternal complications.

Perceived Benefits: Highlighting advantages of early antenatal visits.

Cues to Action: Embedding reminders and call-to-action visuals for checkups.

4. Localization & Inclusivity

Implemented manual translation of key content into Twi for some aspects, addressing limitations of automated translation tools for low-resource languages.

Ensured localized UI/UX to promote engagement among non-English speakers.
